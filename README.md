# dahood
this is made mainly for iku
customizable to fit any alt control by changing commands.

# how to customize
if command does not have arguements put options as ``"false"``
if command has arguements add each arguements by using ``[1] = { description = "Amount to drop.", question = "Choose amount to drop: ", }``
**question** is shown when you choose the command. description is shown when you do "cmds".
**DO NOT EDIT ANYTHING ELSE THAN COMMANDS TO MAKE IT NOT BREAK**
