# dahood
this is made mainly for iku 
<br>
customizable to fit any alt control by changing commands.<br>

# how to customize
if command does not have arguements put options as "false" like this: ``options = "false"``<br>
if command has arguements add each arguements by using ``[1] = { description = "Amount to drop.", question = "Choose amount to drop: ", }`` <br>
**question** is shown when you choose the command. description is shown when you do "cmds".<br>
**DO NOT EDIT ANYTHING ELSE THAN COMMANDS TO MAKE IT NOT BREAK**<br>
